    "* in python there are two ways to make functions: **def and lambda**\n",

    "* def is excutable code \n",
    "    * function does not exist until python reaches and runs the def. \n",
    "    * Its legal to nest **def** statements inside if /while and other defs\n",
    "* def creates an object and assign it to a name\n",
    "    * when python runs a def statement, it generates a new **function object** and assigns it to the **function' name**. the function's name becomes a reference to the function object \n",
    "* lambda creates an object but returns it as a result\n",
    "* yeild sends a result object back to the caller, but remembers where it left off\n",
    "* global declares module level variables\n",
    "* nonlocal declares enclosing function variables that are to be assigned \n",
    "    * allows function to retain state w/o using shared global variable\n",
    "* Arguments are passed by assignment(object reference)\n",
    "* def are not evaluated until they are reached and run \n",
    "* code inside defs is not evaluated until the functions are later called\n",
    "* function defination happens at runtime, there's nothing special about function name, what's important is the object to which it refers"
