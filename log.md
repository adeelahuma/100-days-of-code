# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Installed latest version of Pycharm IDE, installed Jupyter notebook, read about data types in python (numbers & strings - chapter 4 of book 'Learning Python'). 

**Thoughts:** I come to know about few concepts that i didn't know before such as slicing based on negative index, syntax for two level indexing in markdown (knew this but forgot about it). Feeling great after finishing day one. Yahoo!!

### Day 2: September 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Read more about strings, learned two very interesting methods: dir and help. learned about python's naming pattern for polymorphic implementations.

**Thoughts:**  I realized python's built-in methods for string does not use camel notion for method name. Maybe this is with other methods as well. Seems strange coming from Java background. oh well, its Python !!
