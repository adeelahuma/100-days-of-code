# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Installed latest version of Pycharm IDE, installed Jupyter notebook, read about data types in python (numbers & strings - chapter 4 of book 'Learning Python'). 

**Thoughts:** I come to know about few concepts that i didn't know before such as slicing based on negative index, syntax for two level indexing in markdown (knew this but forgot about it). Feeling great after finishing day one. Yahoo!!
